# My name is Sulaiman Zahwan Latheef 
# This is a combination of a timer and weather forecaster/predictor app.
# I have added the timer Tab and this feature implements a robust and performant stopwatch. It uses a 10-millisecond update cycle for high precision and features standard Start, Stop, and Reset controls.
# State management has been achieved with the use of useState, useRef and the useEffect hooks
# The timer updates 100 times per second, displaying time in the format hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds.
# Custom-styled buttons (`TouchableOpacity`) has been used instead of the default React Native Button to enhance visual design and responsiveness.
